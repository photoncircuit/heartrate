# Heart Rate Monitoring System
Bachelors degree final project: portable heartrate monitoring system with bluetooth data transfer capability

The aim of this project is to design and construct a functional heart rate monitoring system. The device will amplify pulse measurements taken from an individualâ€™s fingertip. The system is based on an active band pass filter which will amplify a selected signal frequency while attenuating noise and interference. Signals acquired from the fingertip sensor will be analogue and require conversion to digital. The use of an analogue to digital convertor (ADC) is employed in order for the microcontroller to process the information taken from the individual. After processing, the microcontroller will display pulse rate data on an LCD display and transmit the information wirelessly through the use of the Bluetooth communication protocol. It enables the user to move the device to any area desirable within their homes. A user can then view the transmitted data on an application, using a graphical user interface, running on their personal computers. Implementing this technology allows for users to easily monitor and log data about their personal health. The results collected from thorough testing indicate that even with precautions taken, noise and interference are still major causes of signal corruption.
